"""Write a function that receives two parameters: the diameter of a round pizza in centimeters and the price of the
 pizza in euros. The function calculates and returns the unit price of the pizza per square meter. The main program asks
  the user to enter the diameter and price of two pizzas and tells the user which pizza provides better value for money
    (which of them has a lower unit price). You must use the function you wrote for calculating the unit prices."""
